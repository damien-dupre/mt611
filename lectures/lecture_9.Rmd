# Planning of the Session

You have received by email some data generated from the paper you have selected (or random data if you haven't selected any paper).

In addition to these data, you have received a list of variables as well as their role and the type of effect expected.

Your tasks will be to:

1. Formulate the corresponding hypotheses
2. Represent the model that includes these hypotheses
3. Convert this model in an equation
4. Test this equation with Jamovi
5. Report the analysis of the assumptions for a GLM with Jamovi
6. Conclude on each hypothesis
7. Test this equation and report the analysis of the assumptions for a GLM with R
8. Include the results of the analysis in a quarto template

# Assignment

In the coming days, you will receive an email containing data and instructions for the assignment of MT611.

I will ask you to __submit on Loop a research 
paper using the these data by Wednesday, June 21st__ at 1 pm.

The submitted research paper has to apply the following requirements:

- It will have the __formatting style of a published PDF paper__ (see 
examples here: https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rticles/articles/examples.html),
- It will be __no longer than 6 pages__ all included (references included, 
appendices included). Any page after the 6th page will be discarded,
- The analysis has to include __at least 3 main effects hypotheses__ and __at 
least 1 interaction effect hypothesis__ that are tested __with only 1 
model__.

---

# Assignment

This research paper should include:
  - a __short introduction__ presenting your variables and research question, 
  - a __short literature review__ with no more than 5 references to support your hypotheses clearly formulated at the end of this section (this literature review can be a short reformulation of the one published in the paper where the data have been taken from), 
  - a __method section__  with a representation of your model and its 
corresponding equation, 
  - a __result section__ checking the conditions of application for your linear model as well as presenting descriptive and inferential statistics, 
  - and a __discussion/conclusion__ interpreting the results obtained in regards to the formulated hypotheses.

There is no requirement to use statistical software to perform your analyses.

---

# Assignment

Obtaining statistically significant results (i.e., _p_ < 0.05), rather than not significant results, will not lead to a higher mark. 

The only assessment criteria are the following:

- Accuracy of variables, hypotheses, model, and equation description,
- Conformity of statistical analyses and results’ interpretations,
- Relevance of Tables and/or Figures,
- Overall presentation style.
