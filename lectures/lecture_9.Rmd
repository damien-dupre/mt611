# Objectives

In this tutorial, with RStudio Cloud, we will see how to create:

- **Markdown:** a simple text-only format for writing documents
- **R markdown:** a tool for mixing R code with markdown 

--

#### What do I need to do before starting?

- Sign up for a free RStudio cloud account
- https://rstudio.cloud/

--

#### Where can I find the resources?

- These slides: [slides.djnavarro.net/starting-rmarkdown](https://slides.djnavarro.net/starting-rmarkdown)
- YouTube videos: [youtube.djnavarro.net/starting-rmarkdown](https://youtube.djnavarro.net/starting-rmarkdown)

# Two Sides of R Markdown Files

.pull-left[
<br>
### On the input side...

- Write text in markdown
- Insert code using R
- Write "metadata" with YAML
- Insert equation with LaTeX
]

.pull-right[
<br>
### On the output side...

- Output to HTML
- Output to PDF
- Output to Word
- Many other variations too

# Lots of little things to learn!<br>We'll start with markdown...

---

# What do we want?

- Something that... you can write in **plain text**
- Something that... is **human readable**
- Something that... allows **formatting**
- Something that... can **build** to something pretty

**Here's an example of a markdown document...**

```
## Introduction


Welcome to my **awesome** class. You

# Exercise

In RStudio Cloud:
- Create a new plain Markdown file
- Save it as "my_first_markdown.md"
- Write some markdown about your emotions (positive and negative) triggered by R and RStudio
- Click "Preview" once finished

## What do we want?

- Something that... lets you write text in **Markdown**
- Something that... lets you include **R code** (e.g. for data vis)
- Something that... can **build** to HTML, PDF, Word, etc

# Demonstration:<br>Write an R Markdown document

---

# Let's dissect the document obtained!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/my_first_rmd_plain.png", dpi = 200)
```

---

# The part inside --- is the "YAML"

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/my_first_rmd_yaml.png", dpi = 200)
```

---

# The part in grey is R code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/my_first_rmd_r.png", dpi = 200)
```

---

# The rest is Markdown 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/my_first_rmd_markdown.png", dpi = 200)
```

# Wait... what's the YAML acronym?

- Originally: "Yet Another Markup Language"
- Later: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
- ... it really doesn't matter `r emo::ji("face_with_rolling_eyes")`

# Output HTML

### Simple

```
---
title: "My First R Markdown Document"
output: html_document
---
```

### Complex

```

title: "My First R Markdown Document"
author: "Damien Dupre"
date: "99/99/9999"
output: html_document
