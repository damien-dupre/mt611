# What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard markdown with features essential for scientific communication.

- Computations: Python, R, Julia, Observable JS
- Markdown: Pandoc flavored markdown with many enhancements
- Output: Documents, presentations, websites, books, blogs

See https://quarto.org for more details

--

The Goal is to create a document that is all-in-one

- Documents that include source code for their production
- Notebook AND plain-text flavors
- Programmatic automation and reproducibility

---

# Two Sides of Quarto Files

.pull-left[
### On the editor side...

- Write text in markdown
- Insert code using R or Python
- Write "metadata" with YAML
]

.pull-right[
### On the output side...

- Output to HTML
- Output to PDF
- Output to Word
- Many other variations too
]

--

Try it by yourself!

## Your turn!

In your Posit Cloud:

1/ Create a new Quarto document: `File > New File > Quarto Document`

2/ A popup will appear, untick **"Use visual markdown editor"**

3/ Leave everything else as default and click `Create`

4/ If a warning appears, click `Install` on the message to install the {rmarkdown} package

```{r}
include_img("rmarkdown_warning.png")
```

5/ Click the blue arrow `Render` and save the document as `report.qmd`

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

---

# Simple Example

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("https://quarto.org/docs/tools/images/new-quarto-doc.png")
```

---

# Simple Example

.pull-left[
```{r}
include_img("quarto_default.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
include_img("quarto_create.png")
```
]

---

# Quarto Structure

Quarto files have 3 different types of content:

#### 1. The YAML

Displayed between two series of `---` signs, it corresponds to the metadata shown in the header of the output file (e.g., title, author, date, ...) and the type of output (e.g., pdf, html, doc, ...)

#### 2. The Text

Written in Markdown style (i.e., text without formatting), it is used as core description in the output document

#### 3. The Code

Inserted in the Quarto inside "chunks", the code is processed when creating the output and can display figures and tables

---

# The "YAML"

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_img("quarto_default_yaml.png")
```

---

# The Markdown Text

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_img("quarto_default_markdown.png")
```

---

# The R Code

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_img("quarto_default_code.png")
```

---

# Create the Output File

.pull-left[
To generate the output file:

1/ Go to `File > Render Document` (a  Use the `Render` shortcut icon is also displayed in the menu bar)

<kbd>![](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-render-button.png)</kbd>

```{r}
include_graphics("https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-render.png")
```

2/ Give a name to your document, click `OK`, and voila!

# 1. The YAML

---

# Output HTML

### Simple

```
---
format: html
---
```

--

### Default

```
---
title: "My First Quarto Document"
format: html
date: "99/99/9999"
---
```

--

### Elaborated

```
---
title: "My First Quarto Document"
subtitle: "My Subtitle"
author: "Damien Dupre"
date: "99/99/9999"
format: html
---
```

---

# Execute Code

Quarto can use R or Python to execute code:

- R code is executed natively with the `{knitr}` engine
- Quarto can _also_ use the `Jupyter` engine to execute Julia, Python, or other languages that Jupyter supports

--

.pull-left[
If R code is found first will default to `knitr`

```yaml
---
format: html
---
```

Or can force using `knitr` if you're mixing R/Python content or if your first code chunk is not R.

```yaml
---
format: html
engine: knitr
---
```
]

--

.pull-right[
You can specify Jupyter to use defaults:

```yaml
---
engine: jupyter
---
```

Or a specific Python version

```yaml
---
engine: python3
---
```
]

---

# Execute Code

Quarto also introduces some of these as options for `execute:` in YAML, for similar concepts in other languages.

```yaml
---
format: html
execute:
  echo: false
  warning: false
  message: false
---
```

---
class: inverse, mline, center, middle

# 2. Markdown Style

## Your turn!

In Posit Cloud, with the file that you have previously created:

1/ Remove all content except the YAML and save it as "my_first_quarto.qmd"

2/ Modify the YAML to include:

```yaml
---
format: html
execute:
  echo: false
  warning: false
  message: false
---
```

3/ Write a sentence about your emotions (positive and negative) triggered by R, use `*` and `**` to highlight some part of your text in italic and bold

4/ Add a section title with `##` and a subsection title with `###`

5/ Click "Render" once finished

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

# 3. The R Code Chunks 

---

# Anatomy of a Code Chunk

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| label: organisation-beta-lm
#| echo: false
model <- lm(formula = js_score ~ salary + perf, data = organisation_beta)
```
```` 

- Has 3x backticks on each end ` ``` ` 
- Place engine (`r`) between curly braces `{r}`  
- Place options underneath, behind the `#|` (hashpipe): `#| option1: value`  

---

# First Code Chunk

In the first code chunk, will be added all the __actions that will be applied to the following chunks__ (e.g., code option, library used, data downloaded, ...).

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

# libraries
library(tidyverse)
  
# data
organisation_beta <- read_csv("/cloud/project/organisation_beta.csv")
```

````

---

# Code Chunk Options

Chunk output can be customized with hashpipe options (i.e., arguments set after the `#|`). Above, we use 1 argument:

- `#| include: false` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. Quarto still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.

Additional options can be turned on only for one chunk:

- `#| results: asis` will display the output of the code as regular text

See the **[Quarto Reference Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html)** for a complete list of chunk options.

---

# Figures in the Output Document

As long as the package {tidyverse} is loaded and the data object created in the first setup chunk, then a __ggplot visualisation can be used in a separated chunk__:

.small[
````markdown
---
title: "Untitled"
output: html
execute:
  echo: false
  warning: false
  message: false
---

`r ''````{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)

organisation_beta <- read_csv("/cloud/project/organisation_beta.csv")
```

# My Section Title

My text followed by my figure.

`r ''````{r}
ggplot(organisation_beta) +
  aes(salary, js_score) +
  geom_point()
```
````
]

---

# Working with Code

To display the output of your code in the final document, just include your code in a chunk:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
lm(formula = js_score ~ salary + perf, data = organisation_beta)
```
```` 

```{r echo=FALSE}
lm(formula = js_score ~ salary + perf, data = organisation_beta)
```

---

# Working with Code

Remember, when the code results in creating an object, while the object is created, no output is printed in the final document:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
model <- lm(formula = js_score ~ salary + perf, data = organisation_beta)
```
```` 

---

# Working with Code

To create an object and print your code in the same chunk, the name of the object has to be included in the chunk. This will print the content of the object:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
model <- lm(formula = js_score ~ salary + perf, data = organisation_beta)
  
model
```
```` 

```{r echo=FALSE}
lm(formula = js_score ~ salary + perf, data = organisation_beta)
```

---

# Visualisation Specific Options

Some chunk options are specific to visualisations outputs:

- fig-cap: "caption of the figure"
- fig-height: 5
- fig-width: 5

Note, the default unit for height and width is inches.

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
#| fig-cap: "caption of the figure"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 5

ggplot(organisation_beta) +
  aes(salary, js_score) +
  geom_point()
```
````

```{r, fig.cap="Example Caption", fig.height=2, fig.width=12, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(organisation_beta) +
  aes(salary, js_score) +
  geom_point()
```

class: title-slide, middle

## Your turn!

In your default .qmd document:

1/ Remove everything except the YAML

2/ Create a first `setup` chunk. In this chunk, load the `{tidyverse}` and `{report}` packages and create your data object with the following code:

```markdown
organisation_beta <- read_csv("/cloud/project/organisation_beta.csv")
```

3/ Create a second code chunk. In this chunk, run the following linear regression and add `#| results: asis` in its options:

```markdown
lm_js <- lm(formula = js_score ~ salary + perf, data = organisation_beta)

report(lm_js)
```

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Your turn!

4/ Create a third code chunk. In this chunk, include the following visualisation:

```markdown
ggplot(organisation_beta) +
  aes(salary, js_score) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Employee Salary (Eur)",
    y = "Employee's Job Satisfaction"
  )
```

5/ Render the default document obtained to observe its structure

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 3, warn_when = 60)
```

# 5. Quarto Journal Templates

---

# Quarto Journal Templates

The Quarto team has developed several Journal formats and made them available within the [quarto-journals GitHub organization](https://github.com/quarto-journals/). These formats include the following Journal/Publisher:

- Association of Computing Machinery
- American Chemical Society
- American Geophysical Union
- Biophysical journal
- Elsevier Journals
- American Statistical Association
- Journal of Statistical Software

Many more formats will be added over time.

The quarto use template command can be used to create an article from one these formats from the terminal (and not the console). For example:

```
quarto use template quarto-journals/acm
quarto use template quarto-journals/acs
quarto use template quarto-journals/agu
quarto use template quarto-journals/biophysical-journal
quarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier
quarto use template quarto-journals/jasa
quarto use template quarto-journals/jss
quarto use template quarto-journals/plos
```

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Live Demo

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Your turn!

In your Posit Cloud:

1/ Create a new quarto-journals document using one of the following template from the terminal: 

```
quarto use template quarto-journals/acm
quarto use template quarto-journals/acs
quarto use template quarto-journals/agu
quarto use template quarto-journals/biophysical-journal
quarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier
quarto use template quarto-journals/jasa
quarto use template quarto-journals/jss
quarto use template quarto-journals/plos
```

Say `Y` when asked if you trust the authors of this template and choose a directory name of your choice.

2/ Render the default .qmd document obtained to observe its structure

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

---
class: title-slide, middle
