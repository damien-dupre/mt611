# Vocabulary

"Linear Model", "Linear Regression", "Multiple Regression" or simply "Regression" are all referring to the same model: **The General Linear Model**.

It contains:

- Only one Outcome/Dependent Variable
- One or more Predictor/Independent Variables of any type (categorical or continuous)
- Made of Main and/or Interaction Effects

$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} . X_{1} + \beta_{2} . X_{2} + ... + \beta_{n} . X_{n} + \epsilon$$

where $n$ is an expected effect (main or interaction)

# Notes on the Equations

Equations of general linear model can be written differently:

## 1. Using Greek or normal letters

$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} . X_{1} + \epsilon \; vs. \; Y = b_{0} + b_{1} . X_{1} + e$$

Greek letters (e.g. $\beta$) are used when the value of the parameter is unknown while normal letters (e.g. $b$) are used when the value is know. However few are doing the distinction and Greek letters are generally preferred.

## 2. Using $i$s or not

$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} . X_{1} + \epsilon \; vs. \; Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} . X_{1_{i}} + \epsilon_{i}$$

$i$s indicate "for all possible observations". It is more correct in a mathematical writing but it is usually not used and will not be included in this lecture to no add to much complexity.

# General Linear Model Everywhere

Most of the common statistical models (t-test, correlation, ANOVA; chi-square, etc.) are special cases of linear models.

This beautiful simplicity means that there is less to learn. In particular, it all comes down to $y = ax + b$ which most students know from secondary school. 

Unfortunately, stats intro courses are usually taught as if each test is an independent tool, needlessly making life more complicated for students and teachers alike.
