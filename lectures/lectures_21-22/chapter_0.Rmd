# 1. Aims and Assignment

# What to Expect?

This lecture focuses on the new way to teach statistics:

1. Understanding the basics

2. Using new open source software (JAMOVI and R)

3. Apply these knowledge and skills to research papers writing

In the end, I want you to become a Data Scientist with enough knowledge and skills to:

- Challenge bad science and wrong ideas from your supervisor

- Apply to Data Science positions

---

# Details on the Assignment

Based on your research topic, I will give you some data (in January). Your task will be **to write a ready to be published research paper** that includes:

- A short introduction with a couple of references leading to your hypotheses

- An extended method section presenting the variables, your model with a graphic representation, the equation to test your hypotheses and which test you are choosing to use

- A result section that is publication top quality and additional results justifying the conditions of applications of the tests used

- A short discussion and conclusion

This paper will have **a maximum of 10 pages** and **a publication ready design** (any journal/conference final style but no draft manuscript design).

Appendices are possible, specially if they includes codes to reproduce the results. They are not included in the page count.

**The deadline is June 21st, 2022.**

## Exercise

If you haven't done it already, can you look for the quantitative academic journal paper which is the closest to your PhD. 

You need to download the pdf version of this paper and to send it to my email damien.dupre@dcu.ie . 

Notes: 

- This paper should not be one of yours if you already have published some
- This paper should include a statistical analysis (i.e., Regression analysis, ANOVA, t-test) and if possible their corresponding $p-values$

# 2. Statistics and Research Papers

---

# Why Statistics?

Statistics usually triggers negative emotions to those who do not know anything about it, as well as to those who are experienced but:

- Simple methods to summarise data
- Essential for writing the result section of scientific communications/papers
- Replaced by data analytics/ data science

--

## Tell us about your the quantitative research paper you choose:

- What do you like vs. dislike?
- What do you understand vs. don't understand?
- Any other interesting information?

# Anatomy of a Paper

The shape of the contents of the research paper resembles an hourglass: Starts wide (introduction), then narrows (hypotheses, method and results) and finally opens (discussion and conclusion).

# A Closer Look at Papers

The idea of the hourglass is interesting but basic, it needs some precisions:

1. **The Introduction** introduce your research question (which can be your title too) and includes the variables that you will investigate.

--

2. **The Literature Review** indicates how the variables are related (model) and finishes with your hypotheses. The model includes all hypotheses that will be tested and only the tested hypotheses.

--

3. **The Method** presents 1/ the variables and 2/ the mathematical equation that summarises your model and which includes the test of all hypotheses.

--

4. **The Results** describes the numeric outputs of the tests for each hypothesis.

--

5. **The Discussion and Conclusion** are interpretations of these results. Strengths and weaknesses of the study are also presented.

# Essential Concepts to Master

Everything is related in a paper: Variables, Model, Hypotheses, Equations and Statistical tests.

In Academic Reports, all sections are linked:

.center[**Introduction `r ji("right_arrow")` Literature Review `r ji("right_arrow")` Method `r ji("right_arrow")` Results `r ji("right_arrow")` Discussion & Conclusion**]

To understand the statistics in the results section it is essential to identify the concepts presented in each section:

```{nomnoml, fig.width=12, fig.height=3}
#stroke: black
#direction: right
#align: center
[Introduction | Variables]->[Literature Review | Hypotheses]
[Literature Review | Hypotheses]->[Method | Model & Equation]
[Method | Model & Equation]->[Results | Statistical Test]
[Results | Statistical Test]->[Discussion & Conclusion | Interpretation]
```

Thus, to understand Statistics, it is essential to master the concepts of **Variable**, **Model**, **Hypothesis** and **Equation**.
