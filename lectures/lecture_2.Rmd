# 1. Collecting Data

---

# Data Everywhere

```{r out.width = "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://interworks.com.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.jpg")
```

Big Data?

- Too large or too complex to be handled by conventional tools
- Larger then Microsoft Excel’s Limits (2016)
    - Total number of rows: 1,048,576 rows
    - Total number columns: 16,384 columns

---

# Collecting Data

A tool is required to collect data, but there are tools to measure anything:
  
- Naturalistic Objects
- Economic Status
- Social Events
- Psychological States

A tool, like a model, needs to be valid and reliable

```{r out.width = "35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.publichealthnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/560px-Reliability_and_validity.svg_.png")
```

# Focus on Psychometric Scales

A psychometric scale is a series of questions (items) used to measure a latent variable.

--

A score has to be calculated from all the items to produce the variable to analyse:

- Average of all items (equal contribution to the latent variable score)
- Factor analysis (unequal contribution to the latent variable score)

--

A scale should have been validated by its authors: 

- Don't change the items except when possible
- Don't change items' range of possibilities

--

To be analysed a scale has some requirements:
- All the items must have the same range of possibilities/modalities
- All the items must be analysed in the same direction
- All the items must correlate together (scale reliability)
- A unique theoretical construct score has to be calculated from all the items

---

# Focus on Psychometric Scales

Previously assessed with paper-pencil method, they are now used online with Survey Design Software:

- Google Form (from your google drive, DCU hosted)
- Qualtrics (http://www.qualtrics.com, DCU Business School account)
- Survey Monkey (https://www.surveymonkey.com/, freemium)
- LimeSurvey (https://www.limesurvey.org/, freemium)
- Gorilla Experiment (https://gorilla.sc, pay per participants)

--
  
Remember: Always ask for age and gender

--

Participant recruitment by list of contact/email (between 15% and 10% answer rate)

--

Payed participants:
- Amazon MTurk (https://www.mturk.com/ mainly US and India)
- Prolific Academic (https://www.prolific.co/ world wide)
- Qualtrics
- Survey Monkey

# 2. Cleaning Data

---

# Which Software?

If you don't have big data... use Microsoft Excel! 

Otherwise use R or Python.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://miro.medium.com/max/624/1*FAzumPnvzKUDolMG7SNcHw.png")
```

---

# Question from Kareem

```{r out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/clean_tweet.png")
```

---

# Exercise

## Find what is going wrong with this table

```{r out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/clean_zoom.jpg")
```

---

# Answer from Michael

```{r out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/clean_answer.png")
```

---

# Use a Name Convention

An addition to Michael's list would be to transform headers with a proper naming convention

My suggestion is **snake_case**: all small letter and words separated by "_"

```{r out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/name_convention.jpg")
```

---

# To Clean Data ...

### 1. Ditch the chart and all non values
Charts can mess up with other software

### 2. Column headings in row 1
No more than 1 heading row and remove blanks

### 3. Columns start at column A
Remove blanks before data

### 4. Use a naming convention
snake_case is preferable but any would do

### 5. Save as .csv file
Better format and keeps only the current sheet

---

class: title-slide, mline, center, middle

## Exercise: Clean unicef.xlsx

---

# Exercise: Clean unicef.xlsx

## On the MT611 Loop page, download and open the document “unicef.xlsx”

## Clean the 1st sheet of this file (15min)

---

class: inverse, mline, center, middle

# 3. Transform Data

---

# Master the Key Movements

Most important work is to tidy your data: 
- Takes time to saves time and solves problems
- Only 5 movements are necessary to master (almost) 

.pull-left[
## 1. Extension

## 2. Reduction

## 3. Direction

## 4. Aggregation

## 5. Combination
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/key_movements.png")
```
]

---

# Extension

- Extension = New Column
- In MS Excel:
  - First row is row name (name convention)
  - Second row is the function (starts with =)
  - Following rows are applied (squared corner)

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/extension_img.png")
```

---

# Excel Functions

- For numeric values
  - Numeric operator ( + - / *)
  - $ (fixed parameter)
  - COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), AVERAGE (), STDEV()

- For character strings
  - LEFT()
  - CONCATENATE()

- Extra function
  - IF(condition, value if true, value if false)

---

# Reduction

- Reduction = Filter Column

- In MS Excel:
  - Select header row
  - In Data tab, use Filter
  - Click the drop-down arrow for the column you want to filter
  - Choose values to filter
  
```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/reduction_img.png")
```

---

# Excel Filters

- Rows already filtered have a row index are coloured in blue

- Copy-Paste filtered table in a new document if you want to work only on these values

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/images/filter/filter-result.png")
```

---

# Direction

- Direction = Arrange Row Order

- In MS Excel:
  - Select table
  - In Data tab, use Sort
  - Choose column to sort and how to sort

```{r out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/direction_img.png")
```

Be careful of taking into account all the table (all rows & all columns)

Double check if all columns changed!

---

# Aggregation

- Aggregation = Summary of Column

- In MS Excel:
  - Simple = use function at the end of a table
  - Complex = use pivot table
  
```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/aggregation_img.png")
```

---

# Pivot Table in Excel

1. Select data
2. In Insert, use Pivot Table
3. Drag columns to sort by row/column
4. Choose value column to be aggregated
5. Choose type of aggregation

If you want to use the Pivot Table for further analysis:

- Copy-Paste it in another document
- Paste as value (removes dynamic link)

---

# Combination

- Combination = Join two tables

- In MS Excel:
  - One Column = vlookup function
  - Multiple Columns = Power Query (Windows only)
  
```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/combination_img.png")
```

--

### =VLOOKUP(value, table, col_index, [range_lookup])

- value: The value to look for in the first column of a table
- table: The table from which to retrieve a value
- col_index: The column in the table from which to retrieve a value
- range_lookup: TRUE = approximate match / FALSE = exact match

---

## Exercise: Transformations

---

# Exercise: Transformations

On the MT611 Loop page, download and open the document "employee_d&d_excerpt.xls"

1. **Extension**: Create a new variable/column which is the average response to all the questions from the survey for each employee (q1 to q9)

2. **Reduction**: Filter employee’s 2019 salary to keep only employees with a salary higher than 30k
3. **Aggregation**: Calculate the average salary by gender and by location
4. **Combination**: Using the VLOOKUP function, add to the table a column corresponding to the  2017 salary located in the 2nd sheet

# Extra Analytic Tips

---

# Tidy Data

- Each variable has its own column 
- Each observation is placed in its own row 
- Each value is placed in its own cell

```{r out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy_full.png")
```

---

# Long or Wide?

## Long Format

```{r out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/long_table.png")
```

## Wide Format

```{r out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/wide_table.png")
```

---

# Long or Wide?

```{r out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/long_or_wide.png")
```

--

```{r out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/long_and_wide.png")
```

---

# Reshape Table in Excel

In Data tab:

1. Get Data/New Query> From File > From [Workbook/CSV]
2. Select your file > Edit
3. Select columns to be reshaped
4. Transform
  - Pivot Columns: from long table to wide table
  - Unpivot Columns: from wide to long table
  
```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/reshape_excel.gif")
```

---

# Repeat Action Automatically

In Excel, the Macro button allows to record a sequence of  actions and to reproduce these actions:

- VBA Code automatically recorded
- Useful to process similar data files

Recording a Macro:

1. View Tab
2. Use Macros > Record Macro
3. Do your actions
4. Save the macro with a keyboard shortcut
5. Use the macro again to reproduce your actions
