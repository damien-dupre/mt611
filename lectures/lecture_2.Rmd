# 1. Model Representation in the Method Section of Academic Reseach Paper

---

# Method Section in Academic Papers

The method section is always structured in the same way:

#### 1. Observations

> Short section presenting where the data are coming from. If they are coming from human participants, then their average age and gender is indicated.

#### 2. Variables

> Short section presenting each variable as well as their type and role.

#### 3. Procedure

> Short section presenting how data were collected.

#### 4. Data Analytics

> Short section to display how the hypotheses are tested by displaying a graphical representation of the Model and its corresponding Equation(s).

**While 1, 2, and 3 are straight forward, we will focus on the last point "Data Analytics" as it is uses rules that can be tricky.**

---

# Model Representation

Models are an overview of the predicted relationship between variables stated in the hypotheses

You must follow these rules:
- Rule 1: All the arrows correspond to an hypothesis to be tested
- Rule 2: All the tested hypotheses have to be represented with an arrow
- Rule 3: Hypotheses using the same Outcome variable should be included in the same model
- Rule 4: Only one Outcome variable is included in each model (except for SEM model)

# Structure of Models

Distinguish square and circles
- **squares** are actual **measures/items**
- **circles** are **latent variables** related to measures/items

Example:
- $Salary$ is directly measured (in $, €, or £) so it's a square.
- $Job\,Satisfaction$ is a latent variable with several questions so it's a circle.

Items used for latent variables can be omitted in a model, variables are the most important.

We can distinguish 2 types of relationship in a model:
- Main effect relationship
- Interaction effect relationship

---

# Main Effect Relationship

.pull-left[
.center[Relationship between one Predictor and one Outcome variable]

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.align="left"}

  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]

  }", height = 200, width = 400)
```

This model tests two hypotheses:
- 2 main effects
]

---

# Interaction Effect Relationship

An interaction means that **the effect of a Predictor 1 on the Outcome variable will be different according the possibilities of a Predictor 2** (also called Moderation).

.pull-left[
classic representation:
```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
  
    node [shape = box]
    'Predictor 1'; 'Predictor 2'; Outcome

    ''
    
    'Predictor 2' -> ''
    'Predictor 1' -> '' [arrowhead = none]
    ''-> Outcome
    
    subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Predictor 2'; '';
    }
  }", height = 200, width = 400)
```
]

.pull-right[
is the same as:
```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
    node [shape = box]

    'Predictor 2' -> Outcome
    'Predictor 1 X Predictor 2' -> Outcome
  }", height = 200, width = 400)
```
]

This model tests three hypotheses:
- 2 main effects
- 1 interaction effect

---

# Types of Model

## Simple Model

- One or more predictors
- Only one outcome
- Made of main or/and interaction effects

## Mediation Model (simple or moderated)

- At least 2 predictors (one call Mediator)
- Only one outcome
- Made of main effects only for simple mediation / main and interaction effects for moderated mediation

## Structural Equation Model (SEM)

- At least 2 predictors (usually latent variables)
- One or more outcome
- Made of main or/and interaction effects

---

# Simple Model

Simple Models are the most statistically powerful, easy to test and reliable models. Always prefer a simple model compared to a more complicated solution.

Warning, including interaction effect requires a significantly higher sample size.

Example:

```{r eval=TRUE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
  
    node [shape = box]
    'Salary'; 'Gender'; 'Age'
    node [shape = circle]
    'Job Satisfaction'
    node [shape = point, width = 0, height = 0]
    ''
    
    'Age' -> 'Job Satisfaction'
    'Gender' -> ''
    'Salary' -> '' [arrowhead = none]
    '' -> 'Job Satisfaction'
    
    subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Gender'; '';
    }
    subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Age'; 'Salary';
    }
  }", height = 200, width = 800)
```

This model tests four hypotheses:
- 3 main effects
- 1 interaction effect

---

# Mediation Models

A Mediation model is a complex path analysis between 3 variables, where one of them explains the relationship between the other two. It is usually used to identify cognitive process in psychology.

Example:

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.align="left"}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
  
    node [shape = box]
    'Exam Results'
    node [shape = oval]
    'Self-Esteem'; Happiness
    
    'Exam Results' -> {Happiness 'Self-Esteem'}
    'Self-Esteem' -> Happiness

  }", height = 200, width = 800)
```

This model tests one hypothesis:
- 1 mediation effect
- but it requires 2 main effects

---

# Structural Equation Model

A Structural Equation Model (SEM) is a complex path analysis between multiple variables including multiple Outcomes and using factor analysis for latent variable estimation.

```{r eval=TRUE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = oval]
  'Perceived Ease-of-use'; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Intention to Use'
  
  node [shape = box]
  PU1; PU2; PU3; PU4; PU5; PEOU1; PEOU2; PEOU3; PEOU4; BI1; BI2; 'Actual Use'
  
  {PU1 PU2 PU3 PU4 PU5} -> 'Perceived Usefulness' [arrowhead = none]
  {PEOU1 PEOU2 PEOU3 PEOU4} -> 'Perceived Ease-of-use' [arrowhead = none]
  {BI1 BI2} -> 'Intention to Use' [arrowhead = none]
  
  'Perceived Usefulness' -> 'Intention to Use'
  'Perceived Ease-of-use' -> {'Perceived Usefulness' 'Intention to Use'}
  'Intention to Use' -> 'Actual Use'
  
  subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Perceived Ease-of-use';
  }
  
  subgraph {
      rank = same; PU1; PU2; PU3; PU4; PU5; PEOU1; PEOU2; PEOU3; PEOU4; BI1; BI2;
  }

}
", height = 300, width = 800)
```

This model tests four hypotheses:
- 4 main effects
- because the relationship between items of a scale and their corresponding latent variable is considered as significant by default if the scale is valid

---

# A Good Model

- Comprehensiveness: Explains a wide range of phenomena
- Internal Consistency: Propositions and assumptions are consistent and fit together in a coherent manner
- Parsimony: Contains only those concepts and assumptions essential for the explanation of a phenomenon
- Testability: Concepts and relational statements are precise.
- Empirical Validity: Holds up when tested in the real world.

Example: 

```{r eval=TRUE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = oval]
  'Perceived Ease-of-use'; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Intention to Use'
  
  node [shape = box]
  'Actual Use'
  
  'Perceived Usefulness' -> 'Intention to Use'
  'Perceived Ease-of-use' -> {'Perceived Usefulness' 'Intention to Use'}
  'Intention to Use' -> 'Actual Use'
  
  subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Perceived Usefulness'; 'Perceived Ease-of-use';
  }
}
", height = 300, width = 800)
```

# A Bad Theory/Model

- Too complicated
- Does not explain many things
- Cannot be tested

Is it bad?

# 2. Understanding the Equation used to Test Hypotheses

---

# A Basic Equation

```{r}
df <- 
  data.frame(
    Observation = letters[1:11],
    Outcome = 10:0, 
    Predictor = 10:0
  ) 
```

Let's imagine the perfect scenario: **your predictor Predictor variable explains perfectly the outcome variable**.

The corresponding equation is: $Outcome = Predictor$

.pull-left[
```{r}
df |> 
  kable(align = "ccc") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 14)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r fig.height=7}
df |> 
  ggplot(aes(Predictor, Outcome, label = Observation)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,10)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```
]

---

# A Basic Equation

In the equation $Outcome = Predictor$, **three coefficients are hidden** because they are unused:
- the **intercept coefficient** $b_{0}$ (i.e., the value of the Outcome when the Predictor = 0) which is 0 in our case
- the **estimate coefficient** $b_{1}$  (i.e., how much the Outcome increases when the Predictor increases by 1) which is 1 in our case
- the **error coefficient** $e$ (i.e., how far from the prediction line the values of the Outcome are) which is 0 in our case

So in general, the relation between a predictor and an outcome can be written as:
$$Outcome = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Predictor + e$$

which is in our case:

$$Outcome = 0 + 1 * Predictor + 0$$

---

# A Basic Equation

The equation $Outcome = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Predictor + e$ is the same as the good old $y = ax + b$ (here ordered as $y = b + ax$) where $b_{0}$ is $b$ and $b_{1}$ is $a$.

It is very important to know that under **EVERY** statistical test, a similar equation is used (t-test, ANOVA, Chi-square are all linear regressions).

```{r fig.width=5.5, fig.height=5.5, fig.align='center'}
plot0 <- data.frame(Predictor = 0:10, Outcome = 0:10) |>
  ggplot(aes(Predictor, Outcome)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = 'black', size = 0.5, linetype = 'dotted') +
  annotate("text", x = 5, y = 0.2, label = "Intercept b\u2080") +
  annotate('segment', x = 5, xend = 6, y = 5, yend = 5, color = 'red') +
  annotate('segment', x = 6, xend = 6, y = 5, yend = 6, color = 'red') +
  annotate("text", x = 7.5, y = 5.5, label = "Estimate b\u2081") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0:10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0:10)) +
  theme_bw()

# Relationship between Variables

Relationship between a $Predictor$ and an $Outcome$ variable (stated in a main effect hypothesis or in an interaction effect hypothesis) is analysed in terms of:

.center[**"How many units of the Outcome variable increases/decreases/changes when the Predictor increases by 1 unit?"**]

For example:
> How much Job Satisfaction increases when the Salary increases by €1?

The value of how much of the Outcome variable changes:
- Is called the **Estimate** (also called Unstandardised Estimate)
- Uses the letter $b$ in equations (e.g., $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, ...)

For example:
> If Job Satisfaction increases by 0.1 on a scale from 0 to 5 when the Salary increases by €1, then *b* associated to Salary is 0.1

---

# Significance of Relationships

To evaluate if the strength of the relationship $b$ between a Predictor and an Outcome variable is significant, an equation is statistically tested using all the predictors related to the same Outcome.

The basic equation of a statistical model is:

$$Outcome = b_0 + b_n \,Predictors + Error$$

where the $Predictors$ includes all the $n$ variables used as predictor in formulated hypotheses using this specific $Outcome$ variable and being associated to a specific $b$ estimate.

This expresses the idea that:
- The Outcome can be described by one or multiple predictors.
- The remaining part of the Outcome's variability that is not explained by the predictors is call the Error.

---

# Equations, Variables and Effect Types

Except in special cases:
- An Outcome (or Dependent Variable) has to be Continuous
- A Predictor can be Continuous or Categorical 

Example: $Job\,Satisfaction = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Salary + b_{2}\,Origin + e$

In this equation:
- $Salary$ is continuous with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{1}$)
- $Origin$ is categorical with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{2}$)

---

# Equations, Variables and Effect Types

An interaction effect is represented by multiplying the 2 predictors involved:

$$Job\,Satisfaction = b_{0} + b_{1}\,Salary + b_{2}\,Origin + b_{3}\,Salary*Origin + e$$

In this equation:
- $Salary$ is continuous with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{1}$)
- $Origin$ is categorical with a main effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{2}$)
- $Salary$ and $Origin$ have an interaction effect on $Job\,Satisfaction$ ( $b_{3}$)

---

# Relevance of the Intercept

To test hypotheses, only the $b$ values associated to Predictors / Independent Variables are important.

The intercept is always included in an equation but its result is useless for hypothesis testing.

Let's see why the intercept is always included but discarded most of the time.

Imagine we want to test the relationship between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy of countries in the world. Let's compare a model without and a model with intercept:

- Without intercept: $Life\,Expectancy = b_{1}\,GDP\,per\,Capita + e$

- With intercept: $Life\,Expectancy = b_{0} + b_{1}\,GDP\,per\,Capita + e$

---

# Relevance of the Intercept

```{r}
p1 <- gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90)) +
  labs(
    title = "A: Original Data",
    x = "GDP per Capita ($)",
    y = "Life Expectancy"
  )

p2 <- gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE, formula = "y ~ x + 0 ") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90)) +
  labs(
    title = "B: Model without intercept",
    x = "GDP per Capita ($)",
    y = "Life Expectancy"
  )

p3 <- gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE, formula = "y ~ x") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 90)) +
  labs(
    title = "C: Model with intercept",
    x = "GDP per Capita ($)",
    y = "Life Expectancy"
  )

p1 / (p2 + p3)
```

If the intercept is not included, the intercept is zero and can lead to estimation errors

  - Identify the role and type of each of your variables
- Hypotheses
  - Formulate your alternative hypotheses by using the proposed templates
  - Any other formulation, even if it make sense, is not good practice (e.g. using the terms "has an impact", "is related to", "influences", ...)
  - An interaction hypothesis requires the formulation of the main effect hypothesis of each predictor involved
- Model
  - A model should represent all your hypotheses and only your hypotheses
  - Draw only model per Outcome variable (except is doing SEM analyses)
  - Use the same names or acronyms as your hypotheses
- Equation
  - Formulate your equation(s) in every paper that you want to submit (if reviewers want to remove it, they will tell you)
