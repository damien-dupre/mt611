# Brief Introduction

Modern data science uses free and open-source computer languages:

* Proprietary languages (e.g., Matlab) and software (e.g., SPSS, Stata, SAS) are outdated
* Main open-source computer languages for data science are Python and R

While Python is the most used language by computer engineers for web and app development, R has some advantages:

* **Easy to write**, to read and to use
* Focused on **reports and journal papers** with reproducibility
* Advanced **statistical packages**
* **Friendly and open** community

So let's useR!

```{r out.width="50%"}
# tweet_screenshot(
#   tweet_url("Pop_Watson", "1280351422953840640"),
#   maxwidth = 300,
#   hide_media = TRUE,
#   theme = "dark"
#   )
```

# 1. R and RStudio

---

# What are R and RStudio?

There are some key concepts you need to understand and to remember:

* R is the name of the language
* RStudio is the name of the upgraded interface to write R code

R is usually used via RStudio and First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest, **R is like a car’s engine** while **RStudio is like a car’s dashboard**.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default", fig.cap="R: The engine (left); RStudio: The dashboard (right)"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/car_motor.jpeg")
knitr::include_graphics("img/car_dashboard.jpeg")
```

# Rstudio Cloud

1. Go to: https://rstudio.cloud/
2. Sign up
3. In your workspace, Click "new project"

## 1.1 The Basics of R Codes

---

# What are .R and .Rmd files?

.R is the extension for a R script: 
- Click **File > New File > R Script** in RStudio
- Includes only code which can be active or inactive (line starts with `#`)
- Used for code testing

Example

```{r echo=TRUE}
# non active code
paste("active", "code")
1 + 1 # everything after `#` is non active and is used for comments
```

---

# What are .R and .Rmd files?

.Rmd is the extension for a R Markdown file: 
- Click **File > New File > R Markdown...** in RStudio
- Refers to a document that includes code and text
- Generates a specific type of output
  - .html (web page and slides)
  - .pdf (Academic LaTex papers + additional outputs)
  - .doc (MS Word documents)
  
```{r out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/59f29676ef5e4d74685e14f801bbc10c2dbd3cef/c0688/lesson-images/markdown-1-markup.png")
```

---

# How to Run R Code?

In a R Script, place your cursor anywhere on the line you want to run and either:
- Press `Ctrl` & `Enter` (Win) / `Command` & `Enter` (Mac)
- Click the `Run` button on RStudio's interface

In a R Markdown:
- Use the above to run a specific line
- Use the **green** arrow to run the current chunk of code
- Use the `Knit` button on RStudio's interface to create the output file

```{r out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://appsilon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4_blog_code_execution_optimized.gif")
```

---

# What are R packages?

R packages extend the functionality of R. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet.

A good analogy for **R packages are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone**.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.align="default", fig.cap="R: A new phone (left); R Packages: Apps you can download (right)"}

knitr::include_graphics("img/phone_design.jpeg")
knitr::include_graphics("img/phone_apps.jpeg")
```

---

# What are R packages?

Say you have purchased a new phone, to use Instagram you need to **install the app once** and to **open the app** every time you want to use it.

The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to:

* **Install the package** with the function `install.packages()`.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("norris")
```

* **“Load” the package** with the function `library()`. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(norris)
```

Once the package is loaded you can use all the functions from this package such as:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
get_random_joke()
```

---

# Calling Functions

Functions are algorithms (or lines of code) which transform data to something else. For example, the function `lm()`, uses data to compute the result of a linear regression model.
 
Functions are called by their name and have several arguments that require some information.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
function_name(argument_1 = value_1, argument_2 = value_2, ...)
```

For example, the function `seq()` makes a sequences of numbers:
* The first argument `from` is the number starting the sequence
* The second argument `to` is last number of the sequence

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
seq(from = 1, to = 10)
```

---

# Type of Values and Objects in R

It is very important to distinguish values and objects in R:

```{r}
tibble::tribble(
                  ~Type,            ~Class,                        ~Example, 
               "Number",   "Numeric Value",                     "1, 2, ...",
     "Word with quotes", "Character Value",             '"one", "two", ...',
  "Word without quotes",     "Object Name", "function name, data name, ..."
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

An object is a box that **can include anything** (e.g., values, dataframes, figures, models, functions, ...) and **has a name** that you have to choose. 

To create an object, you need to **assign something** to a name using the `<-` operator. If you type the name of the object, R will print out its content.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- 4
x
```

---

# Different R Objects

All object assignments have the same form:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
object_name <- object_content
```

You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words. I recommend **snake_case** where you separate lowercase words with `_`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
numeric_value <- 1

character_value <- "one"

vectors_with_numeric_values <- c(1, 2)

vectors_with_character_values <- c("one", "two")

dataframe_example <- data.frame(col1 = c("one", "two"), col2 = c(1, 2))

dataframe_example <- data.frame(
  col1 = vectors_with_character_values, 
  col2 = vectors_with_numeric_values
  )

plot_example <- plot(dataframe_example)
```

## Exercise 1

Open a R Script in RStudio. In this document:
- Use line 1 to **install the package "praise"**
- Use line 2 to **load the library praise**
- Use line 3 to **run the function `praise()`** as it is, without arguments

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

---
class: title-slide, middle

## Exercise 2

In the same R Script in RStudio, **Copy and Paste** the following code and **display the content** of each object :

```
power_values <- c(0.5, 99.5)

cases_values <- c("without R", "with R")

my_data <- data.frame(power = power_values, cases = cases_values)

easy_viz <- barplot(height = power_values, names.arg = cases_values)
```

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

## 1.2 Data Processing with R

---

# Open your Data as R Object (1)

RStudio Cloud is a free remote computer, the computing is not run on your computer.

To open Data on RStudio cloud, you first need to `Upload` your file on this computer and to `Import` the data in R.

.pull-left[

.center[Step 1: Upload your File]

```{r out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://community-cdn.rstudio.com/uploads/default/original/2X/9/91a128299a9d910f84279be9ecd89b60aa15f20b.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

.center[Step 2: Import your Data]

```{r out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_import.png")
```

]

Remember that .csv files are basically text files.

---

# Open your Data as R Object (2)

For early beginners on the Desktop version, directly open data with RStudio 's `Import Dataset` button.

```{r out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://support.rstudio.com/hc/article_attachments/360017333414/data-import-rstudio-overview.gif")
```

If you see your data in the preview, you can click `Import` to create an object containing your data. A code will be executed on the console, **Copy and Paste the first line of this code in your R script**. You will not have to do it manually once the code is in your script.

---

# Open your Data as R Object (3)

To ensure code reproducibility, open data with the appropriate function (e.g., `read.csv()` for csv files).

The main argument of these functions is `file` which corresponds to the path to a file, followed by the name of the file and it extension:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
my_file_object <- read.csv("C:/path/to/my/file.csv")
```

The following codes will generate an error:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Incomplete path
my_file_object <- read.csv("/path/to/my/file.csv")
# Missing file extension
my_file_object <- read.csv("C:/path/to/my/file")
# Use of backward slash
my_file_object <- read.csv("C:\path\to\my\file.csv")
```

---

# Data Transformation

In R, different style of coding can obtain the same result. The style that I'm using is called **tidyverse** and is much easier to read than other styles:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # Once
library(tidyverse) # Every time a new session starts
```

There are five functions that you will use to do the vast majority of data manipulations:

- `filter()`: Subset observations (pick observations by their values)

- `select()`: Subset variables (pick variables by their names)

- `mutate()`: Make new variables (create new variables using functions to modify them)

- `summarise()`: Summarise data (collapse many values down to a single summary)

These can all be used in conjunction with `group_by()` which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group.

---

# The Pipe Operator %>% (1)

We have see how to create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 using the function `seq()`:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
seq(1, 10)
#  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

If you want to know the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10, you might write some code like:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
sum(seq(1, 10))
# [1] 55
```

The **tidyverse** makes heavy use of the pipe operator (`%>%`), which takes whatever is on the left-hand-side of the pipe and makes it the first argument of whatever function is on the right-hand-side of the pipe. 

Therefore `seq(1, 10) %>% sum()` is equivalent to `sum(seq(1, 10))`.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
seq(1, 10) %>% sum()
# [1] 55
```

---

# The Pipe Operator %>% (2)

Imagine you have a dataset made of 2 columns and you want to create a 3rd column which is the result of the addition of column 1 and column 2. Then you want to keep only the observations lower than 10, you might write code like this:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data_with_third_column <- mutate(data, column_3 = column_1 + column_2)

data_filter_third_column <- filter(data_with_third_column, column_3 < 10)
```

There’s another way to tackle the same problem with the pipe, `%>%`:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data_filter_third_column <- data %>% 
  mutate(column_3 = column_1 + column_2) %>% 
  filter(column_3 < 10)
```

You can read it as a series of imperative statements: 

> Create a new object call `data_filter_third_column` which takes the object `data`, **then** create a new column called `column_3`, **then** filter this column by keeping only the values lower than 10.

A good way to pronounce the pipe `%>%` when reading code is **“then”**.

## Exercise

Install the package "tidyverse"

Load the tidyverse library

Execute the following code:

```
starwars %>%
 select(name, height, mass, homeworld) %>%
 mutate(
  mass = NULL,
  height = height * 0.0328084 # convert to feet
)
```

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60)
```

## 1.3 Coding in RStudio

---

# RStudio IDE

When you open RStudio, you’ll see the following 3 windows (also called panes):

* **Console**: where the results are printed
* **Workspace**: where the objects are stored
* **Files, Plots, Package, Help and Viewer**: where data science materials are

```{r out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_ide.png")
```

The last window **Code Editor** needs to be opened by clicking:

 * *File* > *New File* > *R Script*

---

# Console: R’s Heart

Where R actually evaluates code:

* Ready to process code if the prompt is `>` . 
* If a command is incomplete at the end of a line, the prompt `+` is displayed
* If the console shows a red icon in the top right corner, the console is currently processing your script

```{r out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r_console.png")
```

You can execute code by typing it directly into the Console. However, it won’t be saved. And if you make a mistake you will have to re-type everything all over again. 

Instead, it’s better to write all your code in a document called the **Code Editor**.

---

# Environment: R’s Brain

The Environment tab of this panel shows you the names of all the data objects (like vectors, matrices, and data frames) that you have defined in your current R session. 

You can also see information like the number of observations and rows in data objects. 

```{r out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/r_environment.png")
```

---

# Files / Plots / Packages / Help

* The **Files** panel gives you access to the file directory on your hard drive.

* The **Plots** panel shows all your plots. There are buttons for opening the plot in a separate window and exporting the plot as a pdf or jpeg.

* The **Packages** shows a list of all the R packages installed on the local or remote machine and indicates whether or not they are currently loaded.

* With the **Help** menu for R functions you can access to essential information to use them. Just have a look at some of them by typing `?` followed by the function name such as:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?seq
?lm
```

---

# Code Editor: R's Nervous System

It makes the link between all the previous pane and allows to reproduce actions and behaviours.

```{r out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_panes.png")
```

In a R Script, each line corresponds to a command except if:

* A function is spread on multiple lines until the closing brackets
* A `%>%` operator is used to chain multiple commands 
* A `+` operator is used to add multiple layers to a ggplot

All text starting with the symbol `#` is not computed and used as a comment to give information.

---
