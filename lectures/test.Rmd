# Basic Main Effect Example

Variables:
- DV = js_score (from 0 to 10)
- IV = salary (from 0 to Inf.)

Hypothesis (one-tailed):

- $H_{a}$: When salary increases, js_score increases as well (means $\beta$)

- $H_{0}$: When salary increases, js_score results stay the same ... means $\beta_1$

Equation:

$$js\_score = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} * salary + \epsilon$$
